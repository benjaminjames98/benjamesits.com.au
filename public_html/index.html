      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>My name is Ben James, and I have been an avid lover of computers all my life.</p>
      <p>I began trouble-shooting PCs when I was still a kid, learning my way around BIOS and registry systems, and
        spent most of my teen years dual-booting some version of Linux. When I began programming in college I was
        captured by the practice, and have spent my time since learning, practicing, and building software systems.</p>
      <p>Post-college, I headed off to Federation University to get my Bachelor of Information Technology, spending my
        spare time building database systems and android apps for various non-profits across Tasmania.</p>
      <p>Now-a-days, I work on the North-West Coast of Tasmania, especially in the Latrobe/Devonport/Kentish area,
        building and maintaining IT systems for local businesses and organisations. </p>
